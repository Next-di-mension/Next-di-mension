Hello there! Iâ€™m Srushti, a PhD student at Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen working in Quantum Algorithms and Error Correction.

Previously I was a research assistant at IIT-Bombay, working on Many-body-inspired quantum circuit compactification and associated error mitigation. I graduated a few months back from IISER Tirupati with an MS in Physics.

During my MS thesis at IISER Kolkata, I worked on measurement-based clustering algorithms. At IBM, I worked on developing a hybrid quantum-classical graph neural network (GNN) for tumor classification in digital pathology.

I was fortunate to receive these experiences which helped shape my trajectory as a researcher. Next stop: Complete my PhD :)
